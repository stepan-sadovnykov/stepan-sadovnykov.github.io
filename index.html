<p>Hi! I am Stepan Sadovnykov.
For my day job I mostly do Java programming (with Spring and Hibernate, sometimes GWT).
I also have some experience with JavaScript and C#, dabbled a little in Python, Scala, C++, Pascal,
    several Assemblers, several Basics and (yuck!) Fortran.</p>
<p>Here you can find mostly my small JavaScript projects that I find not too embarrassing to show to a general public, like
    binary clock that you can see to the right (you can find them on this <a href="pattern_clock.html">link</a>,
    but with with LED-like design, clicking anywhere shows/hides hints; adding #textHands to URL will make them display as they are seen now).</p>
